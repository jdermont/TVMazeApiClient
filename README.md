# TVMazeApiClient

A very simple app showing that I am somewhat capable of writing MVP, testable code. This is side project, very early stage of development. It is TV Maze client, it shows list of TV Shows and information.

It utilizes so far:
* simple MVP programming: done search component
* kotlin
* junit tests

Plans:
* simply finish app: save TV Shows, notifications about new episodes
* usage of CoordinatorLayout
* DBFlow for database
