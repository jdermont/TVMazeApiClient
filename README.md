# TVMazeApiClient

A very simple app showing that I am somewhat capable of writing MVP, testable code. This is side project, very early stage of development. It is TV Maze client, it shows list of TV Shows and information. The API is public. http://www.tvmaze.com/api

It utilizes so far:
* simple MVP programming: done search component, mostly done details component
* added DB Flow Database and database entities
* kotlin
* junit tests
* dbflow robolectric tests

Plans / In progress:
* simply finish app: save TV Shows, notifications about new episodes
* main component (list of saved tv shows)
* fancies animations
* technology: usage of CoordinatorLayout, espresso ui tests, more reactiveX
